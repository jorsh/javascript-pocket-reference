### Notes
- JavaScript was created in 1995 by Netscape
- Thereâ€™s no need to actually use a semicolon to terminate a statement because JavaScript interpreters use a process called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).
- Technically, only objects have properties and methods. JavaScript overcomes this by creating wrapper objects for primitive values. This all happens in the back- ground, so for all intents and purposes it appears that primitive values also have properties and methods.
